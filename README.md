# vsort
A sorting algorithm visualizer using OpenGL/GLFW/C++

# project summary
I messed up the code big time and now I have an entire useless project. I'd have to rewrite the entire project again to fix the problems. So, i've decided to scrap building the visualizer with GLFW//OpenGL//C++ and switched to SDL2//OpenGL//C++. This decision made my life much easier and the other visualizer project made with SDL2 will be completed within a few days.
